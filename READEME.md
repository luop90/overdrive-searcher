# Overdrive Searcher
A simple python script to search all overdrive libraries you specify.

Currently will only do audiobooks, since that's the only thing I use it for.

## To Use
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `python add_library.py`, enter in all the library names in the SUBDOMAIN.
	- So if the url is "x.overdrive.com", enter in "x" (without quotes)
3. Run `python main.py`, and follow the steps given.
